# Adopt & Learn: Play with Your Buddy!
Welcome to Adopt & Learn â€” an interactive web experience designed to educate and entertain users about pet care and animal adoption, featuring a fun mini-game where you can play with your virtual buddy!

About the Project
"Saving lives (and having fun) is just a click away!"

This web app simulates a heartwarming world where users can:

Discover & Adopt: Learn about various pets and simulate the adoption process.

Track Coins: Earn virtual coins from adopting pets and playing games.

Customize Pets: Use earned coins to buy items for their adopted companions.

Play Mini-Games: Engage in interactive games, like "Cat-ch Me If You Can," to bond with their virtual pet and earn rewards.

Interact with a Bot: Get quick answers and announcements to enhance the learning and playing experience.

Experience a 3D Play Area: Dive into an immersive environment for the mini-game.

Inspired by the joy of pet ownership and the importance of responsible care, we aim to make people more aware of animals in need and the fun of interacting with them, all within an engaging and playful setting.

## Core Functionality
To stimulate continuous engagement and learning, "Adopt & Learn" features a unique gameplay loop:

Timed Adoption System: Every 2 hours (set to 2 minutes in development for quick demonstration), users are eligible to adopt a new animal companion from the available selection. This encourages regular visits and interaction.

Coin Economy:

With each adopted animal, you receive 5 cash coins.

These cash coins can then be used to purchase various items for any of your adopted animals, allowing for personalization and enhanced care.

Interactive Bot Integration: An AI-powered bot is integrated into the site to provide instant answers to user questions and deliver important announcements, making the experience more interactive and informative.

Post-Adoption Actions: After successfully adopting an animal, two key options become available:

"Learn More" Button: Send a direct message to the integrated bot to receive detailed information about your newly adopted pet.

"Play Game" Button: Dive into the exciting 3D mini-game "Cat-ch Me If You Can" with your buddy.
